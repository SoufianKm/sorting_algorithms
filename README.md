# C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## Overview
Welcome to the "C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O" project! This project delves into the implementation of diverse sorting algorithms using the C programming language. The key contributor to this project is Soufiane KAMMA.

## Introduction
Sorting lies at the core of computer science, and this project aims to unravel its intricacies through hands-on coding in C. By actively working with sorting algorithms, we gain a practical understanding of how computers efficiently organize and arrange data. Soufiane KAMMA has poured efforts into ensuring that this project is both informative and engaging.

## Background Context
This project is tailored for pairs of students, encouraging collaborative pair programming, especially for the mandatory part. To kickstart your journey, acquaint yourself with sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and peruse resources such as sorting algorithm animations, detailed CS50 Algorithms explanations by David Malan, and other pertinent materials.

## Learning Objectives
By the project's culmination, you should proficiently explain the following without resorting to external assistance:

### General
1. Implement a minimum of four distinct sorting algorithms in C.
2. Grasp the essence of Big O notation and adeptly evaluate an algorithm's time complexity.
3. Discern the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given input based on its inherent characteristics.
4. Define and comprehend the concept of a stable sorting algorithm.

This project transcends mere code writing; it's about unraveling the principles underlying sorting algorithms, understanding their efficiency, and making informed decisions when choosing an algorithm for a specific context.
